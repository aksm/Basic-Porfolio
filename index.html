I drew some pictures I thought fairly good when I was fifty, but really nothing I did before the age of seventy was of any value at all. At seventy-three I have at last caught every aspect of nature&mdash;birds, fish, animals, insects, trees, grasses, all. When I am eighty I shall have developed still further, and I will really master the secrets of art at ninety. When I reach a hundred my work will be truly sublime, and my final goal will be attained around the age of one hundred and ten, when every line and dot I draw will be imbued with life. &mdash;Hokusai</blockquote>An aspiring developer (and occasional painter), I aim for Hokusai's level of dedication. When not coding, I'm working my way through the complete works of Shakespeare, gaining fluency in Spanish and Korean, and tinkering in all things that take to tinkering.</p>
